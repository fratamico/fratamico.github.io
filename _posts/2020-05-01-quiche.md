This recipe makes one quiche. 

**Prep the crust**

**Step 1:** Preheat the over to 375. Thaw puff pastry crust (microwave if needed). Stretch over pie pan. Use a fork to lightly prick the bottom and sides of the puff pastry. Bake for 10 mins. May need to reshape the crust as it tends to puff.


**Carmelize the onions**

**Step 1:** Peel the onion. Chop it so that you have full circles. Add the butter, onions, and some salt to the pan. Stir over medium heat until carmelized, about 30 mins. Add chopped garlic for 5 minutes once onions are almost done. 


**Prep the quiche**

**Step 1:** Beat the eggs. Stir in the milk, yogurt, flour, and some salt. 

**Step 2:** Microwave the frozen spinach for 2 minutes. Squeeze out the water and add to the egg mixture.

**Step 3:** Cut the gruyere into small pieces. Add that and crumbled feta to the egg mixture. 

**Step 4:** Cut the onions into small pieces once caramelized and stirr into the egg mixture. 

**Step 5:** Bake for ~40 minutes at 375, until set. Add sliced tomatoes to the top of the quiche and cook for 5 additional minutes.
