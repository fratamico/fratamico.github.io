Bechamel (mozarella cheese rustic cut, milk, flour) x3 https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/white-sauce-or-bechamel-sauce-40046 (no pepper, but add 12 oz mozzarella)

6-12 Garlic for bechamel

Extra cheese to put on top (rustic cut!)



Notes:

Undercook the mushrooms slightly
Heat the spinach and drain it if needed
Make bechamel, add 4/5 of the cheese and mix it with tomato sauce
Start with sauce and lasagna plates on the bottom and then build up the lasagna, adding 2-3 ingredients between each plate layer
Lasagna plates should be fully covered in sauce so they cook well
Finish with sauce on top
Put in oven for about 40-60 minutes. 10 minutes before it’s done, add extra cheese on top. It’s done when the cheese is golden
